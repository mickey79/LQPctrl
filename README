This package implements a generic dynamic controller in Python.
It is especially dedicated to the control of humanoid, with the possibility to
run walking task.

This package works with the dynamic simulator Arboris-python
(https://github.com/salini/arboris-python).
It needs CVXopt package (http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/) to work properly.

Some results, described in my thesis, are available on my ISIR website:
