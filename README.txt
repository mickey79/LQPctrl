This package implements a generic dynamic controller in Python.
It is especially dedicated to the control of humanoid, with the possibility to
perform walking task.

This package works with the dynamic simulator `Arboris-python
<https://github.com/salini/arboris-python>`_.
It needs `cvxopt package <http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/>`_ to work properly.

Some results, described in my thesis, are available on my `ISIR website
<http://www.isir.upmc.fr/index.php?op=view_profil&id=121&pageid=821&old=N&lang=en>`_.
